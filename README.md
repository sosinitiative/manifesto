# Sustainable Open Source Initiative
We as a company building software are heavily reliant on and invested in Open Source. Our products would not be able to exist without the work of thousands of developers that do not work for us. Open source is vital to our business. We build our software on top of the work of community heroes. The open source efforts of individuals and companies allows us to focus on our core business **without having to reinvent the wheel.**

We **cannot** only be consumers and expect premium support from passionate individuals. We recognize we have a **responsibility** to keep the ecosystem and the community healthy.

## Commitment

We will stimulate all efforts creating a healthy culture towards the use and contribution of OSS by:

- [x] Having our developers adhere to the SOS Developer Guidelines.
- [x] Sharing our own learnings with the world. Through talks, blogs, videos and educational content.
- [x] Sharing our code that could help others as open source where possible, considering intellectual property of our core business and security.
- [x] Not forcing our agendas to a project.
- [x] Allowing our developers contribute code and documentation to relevant projects during working hours and company machines.
- [x] Helping out or sponsoring projects and maintainers that are crucial for our business.

## Goals

By committing to the sustainable open source initiative we believe we will have a positive effect on the community and on our own business. By getting familiar with the open source way of working, our own code and documentation quality will improve. We will be a great place to work for like minded developers. The projects we love and need will blossom and might even become a source of income for the maintainer.

## SOS Developer guidelines

We want our developers to help us make the ecosystem a better place. We will make sure that our developers will follow these guidelines.
